# MERN-CRUD-APPLICATION

CRUD OPERATIONS ON FULL MERN STACK - (MONGODB,EXPRESS JS, REACT JS, NODE JS)

 we build CRUD functionalities on MERN stack application using express, mongoose Cors and axios!
 
 During this prroject i learned about how to perform crud(create,read,update,delete) operations using node js the database used here is mongodb.
 Front end is react js,but I did'nt design frontend beautifully, I concentrated more on backend. This build for my learning purpose for a new project I am doing for my company.
 
 Using this app you can add your items, and list of items will display on frontend,you can update and delete added item.
